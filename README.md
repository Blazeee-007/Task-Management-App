#Task Management App
This project implements a collaborative task management application using React, Firebase, and Material-UI.  It allows teams to create, manage, and share tasks efficiently.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using Firebase Authentication (email/password, potentially other providers).
Task Creation and Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks with titles and descriptions.
Task Listing: View all tasks in a clear and organized list.
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored and synchronized in real-time using Firebase Firestore (or Realtime Database).
UI Framework: Built with React and Material-UI for a modern and user-friendly interface.
Routing: Uses React Router for navigation between different views (task list, task creation/editing, login).
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Material-UI, React Router
Backend: Firebase (Firestore or Realtime Database), Firebase Authentication
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
A Firebase project set up with the necessary services (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database).
Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url> (Replace <repository_url> with the actual Git repository URL).
Navigate to the project directory: cd task-manager
Install dependencies: npm install
Configure Firebase: Replace placeholder Firebase configuration values in src/App.jsx with your project's credentials.
Running the app:

Start the development server: npm run dev (or npx vite)
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173/ (or the port specified by Vite).
Deployment
Deployment instructions would depend on your chosen hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting).  Generally, you would build the application using npm run build and then deploy the resulting build artifacts to your chosen platform.

Further Development
This is a basic implementation.  Future improvements could include:

Advanced Task Management: Adding features like task assignment, deadlines, priorities, subtasks, progress tracking, and more.
Collaboration Features: Implementing real-time collaboration features (e.g., simultaneous editing, commenting).
Improved UI: Adding more sophisticated UI elements and styling.
Testing: Adding unit and integration tests.
